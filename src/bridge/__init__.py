"""
qai-trader.bridge

Integration layer between Python and external execution environments (e.g., MT5).
This is intentionally empty now; later we will add adapters for MQL5/MetaTrader 5.

TODO:
- Define a clear, typed interface for the bridge (send/receive)
- Implement a local mock bridge for development
 
Sprint 1 additions:
- The `mt5_bridge` module provides minimal signal data types and a
	helper to write simple ".sig" files that the MT5 EA can read.
	The implementation is intentionally minimal and designed for local
	filesystem signaling (no network or live trading logic).
