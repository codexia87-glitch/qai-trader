Feature engineering pipeline stubs for qai-trader.

Sprint 4: provide a small, composable pipeline API where Feature
components implement `transform(records)` and the `FeaturePipeline`
applies them in sequence. No heavy numeric libraries are required at
this stage â€” just contracts and simple examples.
